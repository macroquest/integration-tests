# MQNext Test Suite
Macroquest Next Integration Tests

<br/>

## Features
- Tests written in fun and easy to use Lua programming language
- Simple to use Testing Framework based on [u-test](https://github.com/IUdalov/u-test)
- Tests broken out by Top Level Objects for easy problem identification
- TLOs that expose multiple DataTypes seperated into individual Test suites

<br/>

## Getting Started
- Clone the project in your MQNext lua folder (this will create a subfolder called "TestSuite")
- All tests (so far) are based on a Heroic level 85 Male Troll Shadow Knight
- Do not self-buff
- Do not click on any "clickie" eqiupment
- Be wary of areas where you may be inadverantly buffed while running tests
- Park the SK in PoK

<br/>

## Run your tests

- Ensure the MQ2Lua Plugin is installed
`plugin mq2lua load`

- Run the "Me" TLO
`/lua run TestSuite/Me-TLO`
